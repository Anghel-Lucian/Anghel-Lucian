### Hi!. 

I'm a software engineer. I like Go, TS, Linux, and learning about security, cloud and distributed systems. I also like books like LOTR and games like Fallout.

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucian-anghel-3a25331b6/) if you want.

I'm currently building stuff for network admins.
